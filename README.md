# Tourism Frontend Project by Aadesh Thade.

This is the frontend application for a tourism management system built using **AngularJS**. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing destinations, activities, hotels, and payments, along with user authentication.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login.
- **Destination Management**: View and manage tourist destinations.
- **Activity Management**: Browse and manage various activities associated with each destination.
- **Hotel Management**: Access hotel listings, including details and availability.
- **Payment Processing**: Facilitate payments for bookings and transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web application.
- **AngularJS**: Framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and UI components.
- **REST API**: Communicates with the backend services to fetch and manage data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tourism-frontend.git


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
